## Apprenticeship Projects Documentation
Back in 2019, I joined ACS Systemhaus GmbH in Germany as an Intern student in the field of full stack web development. During my apprenticeship I have done lots of important tasks based on customers' demands. This is the repository where you can see some of them as project documentation.
